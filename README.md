# SEIF-View: Symbolic Drift Explorer for Human + Machine Narratives

**SEIF-View** is a symbolic coherence monitoring tool designed to help developers and researchers visualize hallucination, drift, and alignment loss in language models and reflective agents.

It offers an interpretive lens into AI outputs through the Symbolic Emergent Intent Framework (SEIF) — focusing on clarity, coherence, narrative support, and symbolic stability.

---

## Features

- Visualize symbolic drift and hallucination potential over time
- Evaluate prompts and responses using placeholder SEIF metrics
- Plot relational coherence, clarity, and emotional interference scores
- Export symbolic stability summaries
- CLI + Streamlit UI interface (basic setup)

---

## Use Cases

- AI alignment monitoring
- GPT hallucination detection
- Narrative psychology experiments
- Symbolic system feedback visualization

---

## How to Use

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/yourname/seif-view.git
cd seif-view

# Run symbolic analysis
python seif_view.py --input "What is the meaning of life?"

# (Optional) Launch Streamlit UI
streamlit run interface.py
```

---

## Example Output

- Drift Score (H): 0.72
- Clarity (C): 0.89
- Relational Coherence (R): 0.61
- Ω Stability: 74%

*These are illustrative values for demonstration only.*
